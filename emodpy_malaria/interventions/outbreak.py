            Possible values are: BARCODE_STRING, ALLELE_FREQUENCIES, NUCLEOTIDE_SEQUENCE.
        barcode_string: A series of nucleotide base letters (A, C, G, T) that represent the values at locations in
            the genome. The length of the string depends on the number of locations defined in
            config.Parasite_Genetics.Barcode_Genome_Locations. Each character of the string corresponds
            to one of the locations. The locations are assumed to be in ascending order. Also depends
            on create_nucleotide_sequence_from when it is equal to NUCLEOTIDE_SEQUENCE or BARCODE_STRING.

        msp_variant_value: The Merozoite Surface Protein value used to determine how the antibodies recognizes
            the merzoites. This value depends on config.Falciparum_MSP_Variants and must be less than or equal to it.
            It also depends on create_nucleotide_sequence_from when it is equal to NUCLEOTIDE_SEQUENCE.
        pfemp1_variants_values: The PfEMP1 Variant values / major epitopes used to define how the antibodies recognize
            the infected red blood cells. The values of the array depend on config.Falciparum_PfEMP1_Variants and
            must be less than or equal to it. There must be exactly 50 values – one for each epitope. It also depends
            on create_nucleotide_sequence_from when it is equal to NUCLEOTIDE_SEQUENCE.
        barcode_allele_frequencies_per_genome_location: The fractions of allele occurrences for each location in the
            barcode. This 2D array should have one array for each location/character in the barcode. For each location,
            there should be four values between 0 and 1 indicating the probability that specific character appears.
            The possible letters are: A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3. It also depends on create_nucleotide_sequence_from when
            it is equal to ALLELE_FREQUENCIES. The frequencies should sum up to 1.
        drug_resistant_allele_frequencies_per_genome_location: The fractions of allele occurrences for each location
            in the drug resistant markers. This 2D array should have one array for each drug resistant location.
            For each location, there should be four values between 0 and 1 indicating the probability that specific
            character will appear. The possible letters are'A'=0, 'C'=1, 'G'=2, 'T'=3. It also depends on
            create_nucleotide_sequence_from when it is equal to ALLELE_FREQUENCIES. The frequencies should sum up to 1.

        Adds a campaign event to the campaign with a passed in intervention.

        start_day: The day the intervention is given out.
        demographic_coverage: This value is the probability that each individual in the target population will
            receive the intervention. It does not guarantee that the exact fraction of the target population set by
            Demographic_Coverage receives the intervention.
