## Description

This package provides a Python scriptable interface for configuring EMOD for malaria modeling. This Python interface abstracts the process of creating JSON formatted files for parameter specification, demographics specification and intervention specification along as well as abstracting the process of creating binary climate and migration files.

## Get `emodpy-malaria`
