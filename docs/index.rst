===========================
Welcome to |EMODPY_malaria|
===========================

|EMODPY_malaria| is a collection of Python scripts and utilities created to
streamline user interactions with |EMOD_s| and |IT_s| for modeling malaria.
Much of  the functionality is inherited from the
:doc:`emod_api:emod_api_index` and :doc:`emodpy:emodpy_index` packages.

Additional information about how to use |IT_s| can be found in
:doc:`idmtools:index`.  Additional information about |EMOD_s| malaria
parameters can be found in :doc:`emod-malaria:parameter-overview`.

See :doc:`idmtools:index` for a diagram showing how |IT_s| and each of the
related packages are used in an end-to-end workflow using |EMOD_s| as the
disease transmission model.
