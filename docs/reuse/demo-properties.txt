Node properties and individual properties are set similarly and share many of the same parameters.
Properties can be thought of as tags that are assigned to nodes or individuals and can then be used
to either target interventions to nodes or individuals with certain properties (or prevent them from
being targeted). For example, you could define individual properties for disease risk and then
target an intervention to only those at high risk. Similarly, you could define properties for node
accessibility and set lower intervention coverage for nodes that are difficult to access.

Individual properties are also used to simulate health care cascades. For example, you can
disqualify an individual who would otherwise receive an intervention; such as treating a segment of
the population with a second-line treatment but disqualifying those who haven't already received the
first-line treatment. Then you can change the property value after the treatment has been received.

The **NodeProperties** section is a top-level section at the same level as **Defaults** and **Nodes**
that contains parameters that assign properties to nodes in a simulation. The
**IndividualProperties** section is under either **Defaults** or **Nodes** and contains parameters
that assign properties to individuals in a simulation.

:doc:`model-properties` provides more guidance.
