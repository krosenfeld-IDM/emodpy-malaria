"Individual_Sampling_Type","enum","NA","NA","TRACK_ALL","The type of individual human sampling to use, which can be used to down sample large populations, certain age groups, or the immune population that does not contribute to transmission. Possible values are: 

TRACK_ALL
    Each person in the population is tracked as a single Individual object with a sampling weight of 1.
FIXED_SAMPLING
    Members of the population are added to the simulation with a probability of **Base_Individual_Sample_Rate** and sampling weight of 1 / **Base_Individual_Sample_Rate**. This allows a smaller set of Individual objects to represent the overall population. 
ADAPTED_SAMPLING_BY_POPULATION_SIZE
    For each node, a maximum number of Individual objects is tracked (set in **Max_Node_Population_Samples**). If the population is smaller than this number, each person is tracked with a sampling rate of 1; if the population is larger, members of the population are added to the simulation with a probability of **Max_Node_Population_Samples** / population and sampling weight of population / **Max_Node_Population_Samples**. This setting is useful for simulations over large geographic areas with large heterogeneities in population density.
ADAPTED_SAMPLING_BY_AGE_GROUP
    The population is binned by age and each age bin is sampled at a different rate as defined by **Sample_Rate** parameters. The setting is useful for diseases in which only infants or children are relevant by allowing full sampling of these age groups while using fewer objects to represent the rest of the population.
ADAPTED_SAMPLING_BY_AGE_GROUP_AND_POP_SIZE
    Each node has a maximum number of Individual objects as described in ADAPTED_SAMPLING_BY_POPULATION_SIZE, but when the population grows beyond that threshold, sampling is not done at a fixed rate, but varies by age as described in ADAPTED_SAMPLING_BY_AGE_GROUP. 
ADAPTED_SAMPLING_BY_IMMUNE_STATE
    Individuals who have acquired immunity are sampled at a lower rate as defined by **Relative_Sample_Rate_Immune** and **Immune_Threshold_For_Downsampling** parameters. This converges with regular sampling when those parameters are set to 1 or 0, respectively. ","The following example shows how to sampling immune individuals at a lower rate.
