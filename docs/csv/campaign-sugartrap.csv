CONSTANT_DISTRIBUTION
    Use the same value for each individual. Set Expiration_Constant.
UNIFORM_DISTRIBUTION
    Use a uniform distribution with a given minimum and maximum. Set Expiration_Max and Expiration_Min.
GAUSSIAN_DISTRIBUTION
    The distribution is Gaussian (or normal). Values are resampled to ensure >= 0. Set Expiration_Gaussian_Mean and Expiration_Gaussian_Std_Dev.
EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION
    The distribution is exponential with a given mean. Set Expiration_Exponential.
WEIBULL_DISTRIBUTION
    Use a Weibull distribution with a given shape and scale. Set Expiration_Kappa and Expiration_Lambda.

    Use a log-normal distribution with a given mean and standard deviation of the natural log. Set Expiration_Log_Normal_Mu and Expiration_Log_Normal_Sigma.
POISSON_DISTRIBUTION
    Use a Poisson distribution with a given mean. Set Expiration_Poisson_Mean.
DUAL_CONSTANT_DISTRIBUTION
    Use a distribution where some individuals are set to a value of zero and the rest to a given value. Set Expiration_Proportion_0 and Expiration_Peak_2_Value. This distribution does not use the parameters set for CONSTANT_DISTRIBUTION.
DUAL_EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION
    Use two exponential distributions with given means. Set Expiration_Mean_1, Expiration_Mean_2, and Expiration_Proportion_1. This distribution does not use the parameters set for EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION.
