ONE_PER_CORE
    A random number generator (RNG) is created for each computing core running a simulation. When running a simulation on a single core, there will be only one RNG. If running the single simulation on multiple cores, each core will have its own RNG. The RNGs on the different cores start out such that they will not generate the same stream of random numbers. Prior to |EMOD_s| 2.19, all simulations used this policy. 
ONE_PER_NODE
   An RNG is created for each geographic node in the simulation. The advantages of this policy are that 1) an event that causes a random number to be drawn in one node does not cause things to change in another node and 2) changing a simulation from single core to multi-core will not change the results. The RNGs on the different nodesstart out such that they will not generate the same stream of random numbers.",".. code-block:: json
