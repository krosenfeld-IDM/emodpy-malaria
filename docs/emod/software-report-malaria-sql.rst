MalariaSQLReport
================

The MalariaSQL report outputs epidemiological and transmission data. Because of the quantity and
complexity of the data, the report output is a multi-table SQLite relational database (see `DB
Browser for SQLite <https://sqlitebrowser.org/>`_ for more information). Use the configuration
parameters to manage the size of the database.



Configuration
=============

To generate this report, configure the following parameters in the custom_report.json file:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Min, Max, Default, Description
    :widths: 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 20

    **Include_Drug_Status_Table**, boolean, NA, NA, 0, "A true value (1) includes the table that provides data at each time step for each drug the person has."
    **Include_Health_Table**, boolean, NA, NA, 1, "A true value (1) includes the Health table which has data for each time step for the health of an individual."
    **Include_Infection_Data_Table**, boolean, NA, NA, 1, "A true value (1) includes the InfectionData table which has data for each time step for each active infection."
    **End_Day**, float, 0, 3.40E+38, 3.40E+38, "The day to stop collecting data for the report."
    **Start_Day**, float, 0, 3.40E+38, 0, "The day to start distributing interventions."

    {
        "Reports": [
            {
                "Include_Drug_Status_Table": 1,
                "Include_Health_Table": 1,
                "Include_Infection_Data_Table": 1,
                "Start_Day": 100,
                "End_Day": 900,

            }
        ],
        "Use_Defaults": 1
    }



SQL database and table structures
=================================

Because the output is a relational database, most of the tables have a primary key (highlighted in
yellow on the figure below) that is a combination of RunNumber and another value. For example, in
the Humans table, the primary key is the combination of RunNumber and HumanID. Because the RunNumber
is part of the primary key, you can combine data from multiple runs.

The following chart and tables describe the SQL data tables produced by this report. The “many” and
“1” notations in the chart show you which tables have a one-to-many row relationship and which have
a many-to-one row relationship with the rows in another table.

DrugStatus table
================

The DrugStatus table keeps track of the status of each drug in a person. Each person may have multiple records
per time step, so the table may be large. Information on each drug will continue until the drug has expired.

.. csv-table::
    :header: ColumnName, Data type, Description

GenomeSequenceData table
========================

This table contains the sequence and allele root information for each genome. The RunNumber and
GenomeID indicate the particular genome, and the GenomeLocation indicates the location of the
values. The number of rows for a particular genome depend on the number of barcode positions and
whether or not the simulation tracked the MSP and PfEMP1 variants in the genome. This table has a

table has a one-to-many relationship with the GenomeSequenceData table and a many-to-one
relationship with the LocationType lookup table.
