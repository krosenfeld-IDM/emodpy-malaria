===================
IndoorSpaceSpraying
===================

The **IndoorSpaceSpraying** intervention class is a node-level vector control mechanism that works
by spraying insecticides indoors. This class is similar to to
:doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-irshousingmodification` but **IRSHousingModification** is an
individual-level intervention that uses both killing and blocking effects and
**IndoorSpaceSpraying** is a node-level intervention that uses only a killing effect. Do not use
these two interventions together.


At a glance:

*  **Distributed to:** Nodes
*  **Serialized:** No, it needs to be redistributed when starting from a serialized file.
*  **Uses insecticides:** Yes. It can target subgroups using genomes, especially when targeting certain species.
*  **Time-based expiration:** No

*  **Vector killing contributes to:** Indoor Die After Feeding
