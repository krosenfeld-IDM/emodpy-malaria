==================
StandardDiagnostic
==================

The **StandardDiagnostic** intervention class identifies infected individuals, regardless of disease
state, based on specified diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Diagnostics are a key component of 
modern disease control efforts, whether used to identify high-risk individuals, infected individuals, 
or drug resistance. The individual receives the diagnostic test immediately when the intervention is
distributed, but there may be a delay in receiving a positive result. This intervention class
distributes a specified intervention to a fraction of individuals who test positive.

This class is similar to :doc:`parameter-campaign-individual-simplediagnostic`, but allows the user to
specify an action upon receipt of a negative diagnosis.
