=========================
BroadcastCoordinatorEvent
=========================

The **BroadcastCoordinatorEvent** coordinator class broadcasts the event you specify. This can be used with the campaign class, :doc:`parameter-campaign-event-surveillanceeventcoordinator`, that can monitor and listen for events received from **BroadcastCoordinatorEvent** and then perform an action based on the broadcasted event. You can also use this for the reporting of the broadcasted events by setting the configuraton parameters, **Report_Node_Event_Recorder** and **Report_Surveillance_Event_Recorder**, which listen to events to be recorded. You must use this coordinator class with listeners that are operating on the same core. 

For more information, see :doc:`emod:dev-architecture-core`.
