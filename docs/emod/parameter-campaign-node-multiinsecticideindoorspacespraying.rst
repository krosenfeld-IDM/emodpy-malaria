===================================
MultiInsecticideIndoorSpaceSpraying
===================================

The **MultiInsecticideIndoorSpaceSpraying** intervention class is a node-level intervention that
uses Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) with multiple insecticides. It builds on the
:doc:`parameter-campaign-node-indoorspacespraying` class by allowing for multiple insecticides, each
with their own specified killing efficacy.

The effectiveness of the intervention is combined using the following equation:

Total efficacy = 1.0 – (1.0 – efficacy_1) * (1.0 – efficacy_2) * … * (1.0 – efficacy_n)


At a glance:

*  **Distributed to:** Nodes
*  **Serialized:** No, it needs to be redistributed when starting from a serialized file.
*  **Uses insecticides:** Yes. It can target subgroups using genomes, especially when targeting certain species.
*  **Time-based expiration:** No
*  **Purge existing:** Yes. If a new intervention is added to to the node, the existing intervention of the same name is removed when the new one is added.
*  **Vector killing contributes to:** Indoor Die After Feeding
