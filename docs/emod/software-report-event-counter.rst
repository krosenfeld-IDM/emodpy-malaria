ReportEventCounter
==================

The event counter report (ReportEventCounter.json) is a JSON-formatted file that keeps track of how
many of each event types occurs during a time step. The report produced is similar to the
InsetChart.json channel report, where there is one channel for each event defined in the
configuration file (config.json). This report only counts events; a similar report,
:doc:`software-report-event-recorder`, will provide information about the person at the time of the
event.



Configuration
=============

The following parameters need to be configured to generate the report:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter name, Data type, Min, Max, Default, Description
    :widths: 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 20

    **Filename_Suffix**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "Augments the filename of the report. If multiple reports are being generated, this allows you to distinguish among the multiple reports."
    **Start_Day**,"float","0","3.40282e+38","0","The day of the simulation to start collecting data."
    **End_Day**,"float","0","3.40282e+38","3.40282e+38","The day of the simulation to stop collecting data."
    **Node_IDs_Of_Interest**,"array of integers","0","2.14748e+09","[]","Data will be collected for the nodes in this list.  Empty list implies all nodes."
    **Min_Age_Years**,"float","0","9.3228e+35","0","Minimum age in years of people to collect data on."
    **Max_Age_Years**,"float","0","9.3228e+35","9.3228e+35","Maximum age in years of people to collect data on."
    **Must_Have_IP_Key_Value**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "A Key:Value pair that the individual must have in order to be included. Empty string means to not include IPs in the selection criteria."
    **Must_Have_Intervention**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "The name of the intervention that the person must have in order to be included. Empty string means to not include interventions in the selection criteria."
    **Event_Trigger_List**, list of strings, NA, NA, NA, "The list of event triggers for the events included in the report.  There will be a channel in the report for each event."


.. code-block:: json

    {
        "Reports": [{
            "class": "ReportEventCounter",
            "Filename_Suffix": "Node1",
            "Start_Day": 365,
            "End_Day": 465,
            "Node_IDs_Of_Interest": [ 1 ],
            "Min_Age_Years": 5,
            "Max_Age_Years": 10,
            "Must_Have_IP_Key_Value": "Risk:HIGH",
            "Must_Have_Intervention": "SimpleVaccine",
            "Event_Trigger_List": [
                "NewInfectionEvent",
                "NewClinicalCase"
            ]
        }],
        "Use_Defaults": 1
    }


Header
======

The header section contains the following parameters:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Description
    :widths: 8, 5, 20

    Channels, integer, "The number of entries in the 'Channels' map (e.g. the number of events that the report is counting)."
    DTK_Version, string, The version of |EMOD_s| that was used.
    DateTime, string, The date and time the report was created.
    Report_Type, string, "The type of report created (it should always be InsetChart/Channel Report)."
    Report_Version, string, The version of the report format.
    Simulation_Timestep, integer, The number of days in one time step of the simulation.
    Timesteps, integer, "The number of time steps recorded in the file, Each channel should have this number of entries."



Channels
========

The channels section contains the following parameters:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Description
    :widths: 8, 5, 20

    <Event Names>, string, The name of the event.
    Data, array, An array of event counts where each entry is the number of events that occurred during the timestep.
    Units, string, "Empty string, but it is the 'event count'."


Example
=======

The following is an example of ReportEventCounter.json.
